/*
The const declaration has many use cases in modern JavaScript
It is prefered to assing a variable using const , unless they know they need to reassign a value.
But, it is important to understand that objects (including arrays and functions) assing to a variable 
using const are still mutable.Using the const declaration only prevents reassignment of the variable 
identifier.

const arr = [4,5,6] ;
arr = [1,2,3] ; // the console will result in a error .

arr[2] = 50 ;
console.log(arr) ; // the console will display the value [4,5,50] .
/*
Like all arrays, the array elements in arr are mutable, but it is not usable the identifier arr to 
point to a different array using the assignment operator.

arr.unshift(arr.pop()) ; // it so  fun !!  arr = [50,4,5]
